  <summary>LazyPlot is a toolbox for extensive plotting of data in 2D using any standard matlab fit model with minimal coding effort.</summary>
  <description>LazyPlot can be used to both quickly display a figure containing any number of lines and data sets each.
It will also define the axes ranges of the figure, as well as title, x/y-label, the position labels of the legend. Also, by defining the vector "LPQS" before calling "LazyPlot", one can get a glance at the figure by sacrificing some features. Clear out the variable again to enter normal mode again. 
For more information on how to use LazyPlot, open the "LPCodeComp.m"-file. The changelog can have some information about how this came to be. I'd advise reading through the v.1.5 notes, it contains a few useful information on how to operate LazyPlot.
LazyPlot can only plot if all matrices are of the same size. Use NaN to fill up missing data spots, or just call it a second time and plot into the same figure.
The multiple commented matrices in the LPCodeComp-script show other methods for calling LazyPlot.
The function LPFigurefun can be run separately as well, without having to call LazyPlot.
